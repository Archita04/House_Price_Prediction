House_Price_Prediction/Regression Problem

# Overview

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

## **Business Case** :Predicting the price of a house

Using Machine Learning and various data science libraries to build a model that can reliably predict the price of the house. We will use the following pipeline to create a reliable model:

- Problem Definition
- Data 
- Explorartory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Selection
- HyperParameter Tunning
- Model Evaluation
- Feature Importance

## Problem Definition

Create a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the price of the house given the various factors across the market. 

## Evaluation

If we can predict the house of the price.

## Create Data Dictionary

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file.

<h1 style='color:green'> XGBoost Regressor With RandomizedSearch HyperTune Model is the best generalized model with least MSE/MAE to predict the price of the house given the various factors across the market.</h1>

##  <span style="color:red"> Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
    
- The dataset was large totally around 1460 samples with 81 columns including one target variable and after preprocessing 5columns were dropped and missing value filled with mostly mean,median .
- Visualizing the distribution of data and thier relationships,helped us to get some insights on the relationship between the featureset.
- Feature Selection/Eliminination was carried out and appropriate feature were shortlisted.
- Testing multiple algorithms with fine-tuning hyperparamters gave us some understanding on the model performance for various algorithms on this specific dataset.
-The boosting algorithms perform the best on the current dataset.
